Blog Platform Example
=====================
An example blogging platform to showcase use of cascading code generation to build a complete blogging platform.

Usage
-----
Generate codebase using templates in `scaffold` directory, add new logic to the generated code as needed (you may not edit lines of code generated by the scaffold, but can insert new lines). You can later make new changes to the scaffold and regenerate it, the code you added to the generated version will stay and even move as needed if you change scaffold structure.
